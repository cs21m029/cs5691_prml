Since there are more than 1 coding-problems, we had to create seperate coding files.

For Question (1)

File	 	: 1_LinearRegressionTrain
Question 	: 1
Purpose  	: To Train Linear Regression algorithm
How to execute  : open file, enter degrees

File 		: 1_LinearRegressionTest
Question	: 1
Purpose 	: To Test Linear Regression algorithm
How to execute  : open file, enter degrees (5 for best fit OR 11 for overfit)

File 		: 1_LinearRegression_Model_vs_Expected
Question 	: 1
Purpose 	: To plot graph as Model vs Expected y
How to execute  : open file, enter degrees (5 for best fit OR 11 for overfit)

For Question (2)

File 		: 2_PerceptronTrain
Question 	: 2
Purpose 	: To train perceptron
How to execute  : open file

File 		: 2_PerceptronTest
Question 	: 2
Purpose 	: To test perceptron
How to execute  : open file

For Question (7)

File 		: 7a_1 , 7a_2 , 7c
Question 	: 7
Purpose 	: plot graph
